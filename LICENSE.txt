✨ SPECIAL PROVISION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ✨

The authors grant an additional perpetual license to any independent bicycle or 
moped garage with fewer than 10 employees to:
  (a) Use this software commercially without attribution requirements
  (b) Modify the software to match their brand identity
  (c) Deploy internally without open-sourcing modifications
  
We believe great tools should empower small businesses — not burden them with 
legal complexity. Keep wrenching, keep riding, and keep your community rolling.
